DAX (Data Analysis Expression)
In power bi we write dax in three ways:
New Measure: When you want single data or value (Total Sales, Profit, Unit sold). 

New Column: When we want row by row calculation (Logical Function, Divide, Multiply, Add)

New Table: When we want Multiple rows & Columns that time we create table (Group by, Summarize, Calendar, Rows)

Quick Measure: In quick measure we don't need to write dax, we have to just drag and drop required field.
